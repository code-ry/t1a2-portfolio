                    <h2>My story so far...</h2>
                    <p>Growing up in the country town of Wagga Wagga in a military family, I have an expansive imagination combined with a systematic approach to life. I have since travelled to many parts of Australia and the world in the search of new and confronting experiences. Moving out of the family home at the age of 17 to travel New Zealand and go snowboarding, I developed a confidence for my abilities and decision making process to get me where I want to go. Throughout my 20's working in kitchens across the country, I enjoyed working within a team of individuals, striving towards a common goal. Now in my early 30's, I seek to build on all of my previous experiences and expand my knowledge into the tech industry.

                            <p>Welcoming and engaging with people from all walks of life is something I treasure. With differing backgrounds and experiences comes a wealth of knowledge that can not be replicated.</p>

                            <p>The saying "If you are going to do something, do it right" resonates in me. I believe in taking great pride in my work and undertake these tasks with passion.</p>
